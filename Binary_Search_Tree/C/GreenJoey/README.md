This implementation of BST is written in **C 11 standard and styled with PEP8 style guide**. So do use __c11__ or pass __--std=c11__ to your compiler.


I tend to use some macros for logical operations like **&&** and **||**.
So keep a tab open with the <em>bst.h</em> header opened before you read **bst.c**.
